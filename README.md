## üì• **Installation Instructions**

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Prerequisites**

- **üêç Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. This software has been tested with Python 3.x.
- **üêò PostgreSQL**: You will need PostgreSQL installed with the following configurations:
  - **Password**: `1234`
  - **Port**: `5432`

### üìã **Steps**

1. **üì¶ Install Python Requirements**: Navigate to the root directory of this project in your terminal or command prompt. Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries specified in `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **üêò Install PostgreSQL**: If you haven't already, download and install PostgreSQL. During the installation, set the password to `1234` and the port to `5432` to match the software's default database configuration.

    > **Important**: To ensure that your system can interact with PostgreSQL from the command line, you must add the path to PostgreSQL's `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This directory is typically found within your PostgreSQL installation path (e.g., `C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/<version>/bin` on Windows or `/usr/local/pgsql/bin` on Unix systems). You can modify the PATH variable through your system's environment settings. Adding PostgreSQL to the PATH makes it possible to execute PostgreSQL commands from any terminal window.

3. **üõ†Ô∏è Execute PyInstaller**: To build the application, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller dualD.spec
    ```

    This will generate an executable version of the software in the `dist` directory.

4. **üöÄ Enjoy the Software**: Once the installation is complete, navigate to the `dist` folder, find the executable, and run it to start managing your automotive workshop more efficiently.
